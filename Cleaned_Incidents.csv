To further my conversation with Iain on custom foot tracing inclusions from earlier in November, I still think inclusions of foot/shoe tracings are confusing for kitting. In this case, no custom work would be done, as adjustable footplates are not cut to size. Why was the foot tracing penciled in beside the footplate kit? Why was it included in the notes? I think someone further up the commuinication chain should make a determination regarding the actual footplate size and whether custom work should be done, and *only* information pretaining to that should be included in the order. This means only length measurements on molded footplates."
